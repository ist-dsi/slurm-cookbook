# slurmdb.conf is an ASCII file which describes Slurm
# Database Daemon (SlurmDBD) configuration information.
# The contents of the file are case insensitive except for the names of
# nodes and files. Any text following a "#" in the configuration file is
# treated as a comment through the end of that line. The size of each
# line in the file is limited to 1024 characters. Changes to the
# configuration file take effect upon restart of SlurmDbd or daemon
# receipt of the SIGHUP signal unless otherwise noted.
#
# This file should be only on the computer where SlurmDBD executes and
# should only be readable by the user which executes SlurmDBD (e.g.
# "slurm"). This file should be protected from unauthorized access since
# it contains a database password.
